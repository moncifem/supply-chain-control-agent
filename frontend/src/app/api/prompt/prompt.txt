Here is how the shipment process is structured (with timestamps and flags): 
Step 1: Order Transmission - This step involves the initial order creation and its transmission to the warehouse. 
  - Timestamps: `Order Time` (Order Creation Time), `Transmission` (Transmission time)
  - Flags: `Transmission OnTime` (Flag of transmission on time)
Step 2: Pick and Pack - This step involves preparing the order for shipment at the warehouse.
  - Timestamps: `Start PickPack` (Start of the Pick and Pack Process), `Pickpack` (End of the Pick and Pack Process)
Step 3: Loading - This step involves loading the prepared shipment onto a vehicle at the warehouse.
  - Timestamps: `Loading` (Actual loading time)
  - Dates: `Expected Loading Date` (Expected loading time), `Loading Date` (Loading date)
  - Flags: `Loading OnTime` (Flag of the loading on time)
Step 4: Transport to Airport - This step involves moving the shipment from the warehouse to the airport.
  - Timestamps: `Airport Arrival` (Time of arrival at the airport)
  - Dates: `Airport Arrival Date` (Airport arrival date)
  - Flags: `Airport OnTime` (Flag of arrival on time)
Step 5: Flight - This step involves the shipment's journey by air.
  - Timestamps: `Takeoff` (Flight takeoff time), `Landing` (Flight landing time)
  - Dates: `Landing Date` (Landing date)
  - Flags: `Landing OnTime` (Flag of landing on time)
Step 6: Customs Clearance - This step involves the shipment clearing customs after landing.
  - Timestamps: `Start Clearance` (Start time of the clearance process), `End Clearance` (End time of the clearance process)
Step 7: Last Mile Delivery - This step involves delivering the shipment from the airport to the destination store.
  - Timestamps: `Leaving Airport` (Time when the truck leaves the airport), `City Arrival` (Time when the truck arrives in the city), `Delivery Time` (Actual store delivery time)
  - Dates: `City Arrival Date` (Date when the truck arrives in the city), `Delivery Date` (Actual store delivery date)
  - Flags: `Store Open` (Flag if the store is open when the truck arrives), `On Time Delivery` (Flag of the on time delivery)
The flags indicating if each step was on time (`Transmission OnTime`, `Loading OnTime`, `Airport OnTime`, `Landing OnTime`, `On Time Delivery`) help identify root causes of late deliveries by pinpointing which specific step caused the delay.
